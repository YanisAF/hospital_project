# hospital_project

We had to create an application to manage a hospital.


The site was to have the following pages:

- A page for creating a patient (name, surname, date of birth and photo).
- A page to display the list of patients, with a search form by patient name.
- A patient details page where you can see the medical file with the list of consultations, on this page there will be a link to a form for creating a consultation.
- A page for displaying consultation details (consultation date, doctor's name, prescription, care sheets).
- Care sheet: contents of the care sheet.
- Prescription: contents of the prescription.
- The consultation details page links to forms for adding prescriptions and care sheets.
- To create a patient, you need to be logged in with a login and password.
